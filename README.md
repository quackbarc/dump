# dump
so! you've run into my humble coding abode.
this is where i dump random scripts i created, ones i feel like the public ought to see.

feel free to rummage the dump, see what you fancy.

### contents
* **[tetris](/tetris.bat)**.bat -- a snail's-pace but somewhat playable game of tetris.
* **[websafe](/websafe.html)**.html -- a simple real-time converter that rounds a color to the nearest [websafe color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Web-safe_colors).

the batch files below require VT/color support:

* **[colorguess](/colorguess.bat)**.bat -- a game on guessing a color sequence, something like mastermind.
* **[passgen](/passgen.bat)**.bat -- a password generator, as requested by someone.
* **[wordtime](/wordtime.bat)**.bat -- a clock that displays the time in words. directly inspired from [these clocks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49148994/118955921-b996db00-b991-11eb-8db4-53b54cc327a0.png)

#### /python
* **[gol](/python/gol.py)**.py -- an object-oriented simulation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
* **[brainfuck](/python/brainfuck.py)**.py -- a simple parser for [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck "here's a WP article if you somehow don't know about it").

#### /userscripts
* **[sketch](/userscripts/sketch.user.js)**.user.js -- a personal userscript for the anarchy web 1.0 drawing website [garyc.me](https://garyc.me).

> ℹ️ Note: development for sketch.user.js has moved to [another repository](https://github.com/quackbarc/garyc-sketch-tweaks). i highly recommend using that one instead.
