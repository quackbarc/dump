# dump
so! you've run into my humble coding abode.

here, i dump some cool codes i created, mostly in batch.

though i don't use github too much, so don't mind my... incorrect usage of descriptions and general ineptitude of the website.

### contents
* **[colorguess](/colorguess.bat)** -- a game on guessing a color sequence, something like mastermind.
* **[passgen](/passgen.bat)** -- a password generator.
* **[wordtime](/wordtime.bat)** -- a clock that displays the time in words. directly inspired from [these clocks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49148994/118955921-b996db00-b991-11eb-8db4-53b54cc327a0.png)

the above .bat's require Windows 10's command prompt for VT/color support.

* **[websafe](/websafe.html)**.html -- a simple real-time converter that rounds a color to the nearest [websafe color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Web-safe_colors).
